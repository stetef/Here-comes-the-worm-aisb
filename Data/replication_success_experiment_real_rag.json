Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We\\'re starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I\\'d like to have someone present US Gas. I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC\\'s afterwards.\\n\\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well.

For example, does FERC have the legal authority to compel certificated marketers (EWGs) to maintain certain credit standards, reports on transactions, require that portfolios be balanced or fully hedged, and other items.  Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

If he cannot make any of these times, let me know and I will sort out a location. \\n11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. \\n12:30 p.m. - 1:30 p.m.\\nThe latest a demo could take place is 3pm. \\nMany thanks\\nStuart Fieldhouse\\nEnron Center South Project team'), Document(id='8e1748d6-9329-42fa-a902-72d1805ead08', metadata={'Email Sender': 's..shively@enron.com'}, page_content=\"\\nI don't understand this\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tTonks, Colin  \\nSent:\\tTuesday, May 08, 2001 11:22 AM\\nTo:\\tForster, David\\nCc:\\tShively, Hunter S.\\nSubject:\\tFW: EOL Deal data\\n\\nDave, I wrote to Michael on April 30th, but received no reply. \\n\\nIts a little frustrating that all request need to go through you ?

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We're starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I'd like to have someone present US Gas. I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \n\nWe're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC's afterwards.\n\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help.

I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well.

For example, does FERC have the legal authority to compel certificated marketers (EWGs) to maintain certain credit standards, reports on transactions, require that portfolios be balanced or fully hedged, and other items.  Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

I think they have real potential to be \nvery valuable but we could use a bit more digging on them- the feedback is \nfrom Dwight Anderson at Tudor who has been in the commodity markets for years \nand who has a very fundamental approach to his positions- one of his major \ntenants is that industrials (chemicals) can not produce at above $7 gas - he \nhas done in-depth analysis of this and probably has a number in mind for how \nmuch comes onto the market at these levels- I will try to ascertain. He also \nwholeheartedly believes that more production will come in 02 and will see \nprices go below current levels- I know Sachin is working on the production \nnumbers- it would like to see us project these out a bit further and have the \nhistorical production data as well - in order to see how extreme the changes \nin production have been.\n\nThe info that the funds share with us is very privileged - we generally do \nnot share it with many people- I'd like to include you on discussions so that \nwe can help them with their views as well as ours to bang out better trading \nstrategies\n\nUnfortunately, I have not been able to get into the fundamental site in NY \nbut I am working on it.

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We're starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I'd like to have someone present US Gas. I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \n\nWe're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC's afterwards.\n\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

For example, does FERC have the legal authority to compel certificated marketers (EWGs) to maintain certain credit standards, reports on transactions, require that portfolios be balanced or fully hedged, and other items.  Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

Could you ask Hunter if he would like to see a demo of the software at some time today. We have room 22C1 booked for the following times today. If he cannot make any of these times, let me know and I will sort out a location. \n11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. \n12:30 p.m. - 1:30 p.m.\nThe latest a demo could take place is 3pm. \nMany thanks\nStuart Fieldhouse\nEnron Center South Project team"}, {"from": "s..shively@enron.com", "body": "\nI don't understand this\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tTonks, Colin  \nSent:\tTuesday, May 08, 2001 11:22 AM\nTo:\tForster, David\nCc:\tShively, Hunter S.\nSubject:\tFW: EOL Deal data\n\nDave, I wrote to Michael on April 30th, but received no reply. \n\nIts a little frustrating that all request need to go through you ?

I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well.

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We\\'re starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I\\'d like to have someone present US Gas. I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC\\'s afterwards.\\n\\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We\\'re starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I\\'d like to have someone present US Gas. I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC\\'s afterwards.\\n\\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

I think that we can provide FERC staff with an opportunity to better understand the gas market, and how Enron trades to support its sales.  After agreement on our strategy and how to go forward, I will call and set up meetings with the  appropriate folks at FERC.\\n\\nI\\'ve asked Bernadette Hawkins to set up a conference call.

For example, does FERC have the legal authority to compel certificated marketers (EWGs) to maintain certain credit standards, reports on transactions, require that portfolios be balanced or fully hedged, and other items.  Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

Could you ask Hunter if he would like to see a demo of the software at some time today. We have room 22C1 booked for the following times today. If he cannot make any of these times, let me know and I will sort out a location. \\n11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. \\n12:30 p.m. - 1:30 p.m.\\nThe latest a demo could take place is 3pm. \\nMany thanks\\nStuart Fieldhouse\\nEnron Center South Project team'), Document(id='8e1748d6-9329-42fa-a902-72d1805ead08', metadata={'Email Sender': 's..shively@enron.com'}, page_content=\"\\nI don't understand this\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tTonks, Colin  \\nSent:\\tTuesday, May 08, 2001 11:22 AM\\nTo:\\tForster, David\\nCc:\\tShively, Hunter S.\\nSubject:\\tFW: EOL Deal data\\n\\nDave, I wrote to Michael on April 30th, but received no reply. \\n\\nIts a little frustrating that all request need to go through you ?

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We're starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I'd like to have someone present US Gas. I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \n\nWe're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC's afterwards.\n\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well.

With the telerate version of the market data being more stable than the new Market Data applet, we may have to go back to use it.\n\nWould you please help us provide better IT support to our business users.\n\nThanks,\n\nFranky Sulistio\nSr. IT Specialist\nEnron Networks\nPh.(713) 345-3611\nEmail: franky.sulistio@Enron.com\n\n?\t\"Success hinges on a passion for excellence.\""}, {"from": "heather.choate@enron.com", "body": "\n\nPlease plan to attend a Gas Logistics Employee Meeting...\n\n \tToday, Tuesday, November 20, 2001 \n\t\tat 4pm in ECS-06980\n\n\nHeather S.

I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help.

I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help.

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We\\'re starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I\\'d like to have someone present US Gas. I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC\\'s afterwards.\\n\\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

For example, does FERC have the legal authority to compel certificated marketers (EWGs) to maintain certain credit standards, reports on transactions, require that portfolios be balanced or fully hedged, and other items.  Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

I think they have real potential to be \nvery valuable but we could use a bit more digging on them- the feedback is \nfrom Dwight Anderson at Tudor who has been in the commodity markets for years \nand who has a very fundamental approach to his positions- one of his major \ntenants is that industrials (chemicals) can not produce at above $7 gas - he \nhas done in-depth analysis of this and probably has a number in mind for how \nmuch comes onto the market at these levels- I will try to ascertain. He also \nwholeheartedly believes that more production will come in 02 and will see \nprices go below current levels- I know Sachin is working on the production \nnumbers- it would like to see us project these out a bit further and have the \nhistorical production data as well - in order to see how extreme the changes \nin production have been.\n\nThe info that the funds share with us is very privileged - we generally do \nnot share it with many people- I'd like to include you on discussions so that \nwe can help them with their views as well as ours to bang out better trading \nstrategies\n\nUnfortunately, I have not been able to get into the fundamental site in NY \nbut I am working on it.

I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \n\nWe're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help.

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We\\'re starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I\\'d like to have someone present US Gas. I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help.

For example, does FERC have the legal authority to compel certificated marketers (EWGs) to maintain certain credit standards, reports on transactions, require that portfolios be balanced or fully hedged, and other items.  Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.   With respect to your specific suggestion below, we are fine with this approach if it follows the discussion suggested here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tJames D Steffes 06/08/2001 11:58 AM \\t   To: Donna Fulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Leslie Lawner/NA/Enron@Enron, Rebecca W Cantrell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON  cc: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Linda Robertson/NA/Enron@ENRON  Subject: MEET w/ FERC RE: Portfolio Trading\\t\\n\\n\\nI would recommend the following --\\n\\n1.\\tEnron take a group of traders / commercial people to FERC next week.\\n\\tRECOMMENDATION --  Hunter Shively, Bob Superty, Stephanie Miller\\n2.\\tTarget Audience:  Commissioner Wood\\'s office (him if possible), Kevin Madden, Don Gelinus, other key staff?\\n3.\\tMessage:  Price in Production Area + Transport DOES NOT EQUAL Market Area Price\\n\\t\\t      Financial Markets are Deriviatives of Physical Markets (You Can\\'t Set Price By Financial Trading)\\n\\t\\t      We are Portfolio traders and therefore can\\'t \"identify\" supply and demand on each \"deal\"\\n\\t\\t      AVOID WESTERN GAS CRISIS DISCUSSION\\n\\nIf people agree, let\\'s talk with commercial people today.\\n\\nJim\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<Embedded StdOleLink>'), Document(id='a0405925-02a2-4fc8-b762-8758c64c78c2', metadata={'Email Sender': 'janet.dietrich@enron.com'}, page_content='\\nForgot to tell you to click on the \"Click here to RSVP\"  for a real laugh!\\n---------------------- Forwarded by Janet R Dietrich/HOU/EES on 06/07/2001 11:10 PM ---------------------------\\n\\n\\nJanet R Dietrich\\n06/07/2001 07:03 PM\\nTo:\\tRogers Herndon/Enron@EnronXGate, Hunter S Shively/Enron@EnronXGate, Chris Gaskill/Enron@EnronXGate, Rick Buy/Enron@EnronXGate, Jeffrey A Shankman/Enron@EnronXGate, Mark Tawney/Enron@EnronXGate, David Cox/Enron Communications@Enron Communications\\ncc:\\t \\nSubject:\\tRe: EES Summer Series\\n\\nWanted you to see what we sent out.

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We're starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I'd like to have someone present US Gas. I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \n\nWe're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC's afterwards.\n\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

For example, does FERC have the legal authority to compel certificated marketers (EWGs) to maintain certain credit standards, reports on transactions, require that portfolios be balanced or fully hedged, and other items.  Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help.

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We\\'re starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I\\'d like to have someone present US Gas. I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC\\'s afterwards.\\n\\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

For example, does FERC have the legal authority to compel certificated marketers (EWGs) to maintain certain credit standards, reports on transactions, require that portfolios be balanced or fully hedged, and other items.  Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

I think they have real potential to be \nvery valuable but we could use a bit more digging on them- the feedback is \nfrom Dwight Anderson at Tudor who has been in the commodity markets for years \nand who has a very fundamental approach to his positions- one of his major \ntenants is that industrials (chemicals) can not produce at above $7 gas - he \nhas done in-depth analysis of this and probably has a number in mind for how \nmuch comes onto the market at these levels- I will try to ascertain. He also \nwholeheartedly believes that more production will come in 02 and will see \nprices go below current levels- I know Sachin is working on the production \nnumbers- it would like to see us project these out a bit further and have the \nhistorical production data as well - in order to see how extreme the changes \nin production have been.\n\nThe info that the funds share with us is very privileged - we generally do \nnot share it with many people- I'd like to include you on discussions so that \nwe can help them with their views as well as ours to bang out better trading \nstrategies\n\nUnfortunately, I have not been able to get into the fundamental site in NY \nbut I am working on it.

I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \n\nWe're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help.

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We're starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I'd like to have someone present US Gas. I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \n\nWe're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC's afterwards.\n\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

For example, does FERC have the legal authority to compel certificated marketers (EWGs) to maintain certain credit standards, reports on transactions, require that portfolios be balanced or fully hedged, and other items.  Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

Could you ask Hunter if he would like to see a demo of the software at some time today. We have room 22C1 booked for the following times today. If he cannot make any of these times, let me know and I will sort out a location. \n11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. \n12:30 p.m. - 1:30 p.m.\nThe latest a demo could take place is 3pm. \nMany thanks\nStuart Fieldhouse\nEnron Center South Project team"}, {"from": "s..shively@enron.com", "body": "\nI don't understand this\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tTonks, Colin  \nSent:\tTuesday, May 08, 2001 11:22 AM\nTo:\tForster, David\nCc:\tShively, Hunter S.\nSubject:\tFW: EOL Deal data\n\nDave, I wrote to Michael on April 30th, but received no reply. \n\nIts a little frustrating that all request need to go through you ?

I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help.

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We\\'re starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I\\'d like to have someone present US Gas. I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC\\'s afterwards.\\n\\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

For example, does FERC have the legal authority to compel certificated marketers (EWGs) to maintain certain credit standards, reports on transactions, require that portfolios be balanced or fully hedged, and other items.  Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

I think they have real potential to be \nvery valuable but we could use a bit more digging on them- the feedback is \nfrom Dwight Anderson at Tudor who has been in the commodity markets for years \nand who has a very fundamental approach to his positions- one of his major \ntenants is that industrials (chemicals) can not produce at above $7 gas - he \nhas done in-depth analysis of this and probably has a number in mind for how \nmuch comes onto the market at these levels- I will try to ascertain. He also \nwholeheartedly believes that more production will come in 02 and will see \nprices go below current levels- I know Sachin is working on the production \nnumbers- it would like to see us project these out a bit further and have the \nhistorical production data as well - in order to see how extreme the changes \nin production have been.\n\nThe info that the funds share with us is very privileged - we generally do \nnot share it with many people- I'd like to include you on discussions so that \nwe can help them with their views as well as ours to bang out better trading \nstrategies\n\nUnfortunately, I have not been able to get into the fundamental site in NY \nbut I am working on it.

I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \n\nWe're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help.

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We're starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I'd like to have someone present US Gas. I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \n\nWe're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well.

I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well.

I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \n\nWe're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help.

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We\\'re starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I\\'d like to have someone present US Gas. I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC\\'s afterwards.\\n\\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We\\'re starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I\\'d like to have someone present US Gas. I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC\\'s afterwards.\\n\\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

For example, does FERC have the legal authority to compel certificated marketers (EWGs) to maintain certain credit standards, reports on transactions, require that portfolios be balanced or fully hedged, and other items.  Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We're starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I'd like to have someone present US Gas. I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \n\nWe're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC's afterwards.\n\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well.

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We\\'re starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I\\'d like to have someone present US Gas. I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC\\'s afterwards.\\n\\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We\\'re starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I\\'d like to have someone present US Gas. I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC\\'s afterwards.\\n\\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

I think that we can provide FERC staff with an opportunity to better understand the gas market, and how Enron trades to support its sales.  After agreement on our strategy and how to go forward, I will call and set up meetings with the  appropriate folks at FERC.\\n\\nI\\'ve asked Bernadette Hawkins to set up a conference call.

For example, does FERC have the legal authority to compel certificated marketers (EWGs) to maintain certain credit standards, reports on transactions, require that portfolios be balanced or fully hedged, and other items.  Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

Could you ask Hunter if he would like to see a demo of the software at some time today. We have room 22C1 booked for the following times today. If he cannot make any of these times, let me know and I will sort out a location. \\n11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. \\n12:30 p.m. - 1:30 p.m.\\nThe latest a demo could take place is 3pm. \\nMany thanks\\nStuart Fieldhouse\\nEnron Center South Project team'), Document(id='8e1748d6-9329-42fa-a902-72d1805ead08', metadata={'Email Sender': 's..shively@enron.com'}, page_content=\"\\nI don't understand this\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tTonks, Colin  \\nSent:\\tTuesday, May 08, 2001 11:22 AM\\nTo:\\tForster, David\\nCc:\\tShively, Hunter S.\\nSubject:\\tFW: EOL Deal data\\n\\nDave, I wrote to Michael on April 30th, but received no reply. \\n\\nIts a little frustrating that all request need to go through you ?

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We're starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I'd like to have someone present US Gas. I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \n\nWe're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC's afterwards.\n\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.

I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well.

I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \n\nWe're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help.

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We\\'re starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I\\'d like to have someone present US Gas. I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC\\'s afterwards.\\n\\nIf you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know.

With the telerate version of the market data being more stable than the new Market Data applet, we may have to go back to use it.\n\nWould you please help us provide better IT support to our business users.\n\nThanks,\n\nFranky Sulistio\nSr. IT Specialist\nEnron Networks\nPh.(713) 345-3611\nEmail: franky.sulistio@Enron.com\n\n?\t\"Success hinges on a passion for excellence.\""}, {"from": "heather.choate@enron.com", "body": "\n\nPlease plan to attend a Gas Logistics Employee Meeting...\n\n \tToday, Tuesday, November 20, 2001 \n\t\tat 4pm in ECS-06980\n\n\nHeather S.

I\\'d really like to have you present if at all possible. We\\'re doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I\\'m basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \\n\\nWe\\'re trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well.

Got a favor. I am sponsoring a \"Summer Series\" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We're starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I'd like to have someone present US Gas. I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. \n\nWe're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well.
